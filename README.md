This automates grabbing the 450 or so downloadable episodes of the John Peel
Show that have been uploaded to SoundCloud by +dB.

Don't use it to be an asshole, okay? Deal? Deal.

You'll need to change the output_dir variable to reflect where you want the
files to download to. I don't know what the total file size is, but I'm
betting it's north of 50GB, so account for that when choosing a location.

If you want to use this and can't figure it out as is, sorry :)
